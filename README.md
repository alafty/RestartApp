# RestartApp

Restart app is a demo app that consists of two views created for the sake of experimentation with SwiftUI .

*Main Features*

1- Creating reusable components <br>
2- Creating custom components and integrating them with gestures <br>
3- Creating animations and transitions of various kinds <br>
4- Using haptic feedback and sound effects for enhanced UX <br>

I do not own any assets in this app; it is part of a SwiftUI Masterclass found on Udemy
